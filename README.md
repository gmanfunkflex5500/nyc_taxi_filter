# nyc_taxi_filter
Program for measuring hired car data to and from NYC airports, specifically looking at shared rides, wheelchair accessible vehicles, and battery operated vehicles

All code is python, data pulled from OpenData NYC using Socrata and sodapy. 

I will be updating this package soon as I develop additional functionality into separate modules and hopefully create a web app for use to explore Vehicles For Hire (VFH) data and the VFH trip data in NYC.
